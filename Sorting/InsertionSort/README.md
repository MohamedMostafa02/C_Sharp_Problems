# Insertion Sort

This project implements the Insertion Sort algorithm in C#.

## 📌 Description

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much like sorting playing cards in your hands — you take one card at a time and insert it into its correct position among the already sorted cards.

## ✅ Example

Unsorted: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]  
Sorted: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

## 🧠 Time Complexity

- Best Case: O(n) — when the list is already sorted  
- Average Case: O(n²)  
- Worst Case: O(n²)
