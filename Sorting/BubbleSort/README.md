# Bubble Sort

This project implements the **Bubble Sort** algorithm in C#.

## 📌 Description
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## ✅ Example
Unsorted: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]  
Sorted: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

## 🧠 Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n) — when the list is already sorted
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Worst Case: O(n²)

## 📁 Files
