# Selection Sort

This project implements the Selection Sort algorithm in C#.

## 📌 Description

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest, depending on the order) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swapping it with the first unsorted element. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

## ✅ Example

**Unsorted:** [29, 10, 14, 37, 14]  
**Sorted:** [10, 14, 14, 29, 37]

## 🧠 Time Complexity

- **Best Case:** O(n²)  
- **Average Case:** O(n²)  
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)
