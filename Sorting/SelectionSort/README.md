# Selection Sort

This project implements the Selection Sort algorithm in C#.

📌 **Description**  
Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right, and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items. At each step, the smallest element from the unsorted sublist is selected and moved to the sorted sublist.

✅ **Example**  
Unsorted: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]  
Sorted:   [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

🧠 **Time Complexity**  
- Best Case: O(n²)  
- Average Case: O(n²)  
- Worst Case: O(n²)
