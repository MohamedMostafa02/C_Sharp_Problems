# Store Marks of Students in Multiple Subjects - C# Console App

This simple C# console application demonstrates the use of jagged arrays to store and display student marks in multiple subjects. Each student can have a different number of subjects, making jagged arrays an ideal structure.

## ✅ Features
- Uses a jagged array `int[][]` to represent student marks.
- Displays each student’s marks with formatting.
- Demonstrates how to loop through jagged arrays and print values.

## 🧠 How It Works
- The program creates a jagged array where each inner array holds the marks for a specific student.
- It loops through the array using a `for` loop.
- For each student, it prints the student number and the list of marks using `string.Join`.

## 🖥 Example Output
Student 1:
90, 85, 88
Student 2:
76, 80
Student 3:
92, 93, 89, 85
