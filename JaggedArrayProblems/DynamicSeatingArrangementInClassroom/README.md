# Dynamic Seating Arrangement in Classroom - C#
This C# console application demonstrates how to use a jagged array to manage variable seating arrangements in a classroom, where each row contains a different number of seats.

## ✅ Features
- Models dynamic rows using jagged arrays.
- Initializes each row with a different number of seats.
- Prints out each row’s seat numbers in order.
- Simple and efficient console output.

## 🧠 How It Works
- Declares a jagged array: `int[][] classroomSeats = new int[3][];`
- Initializes each sub-array with seat numbers for a particular row.
- Iterates through each row using a for-loop.
- Uses a foreach-loop inside to print seat numbers.
- Displays row number and seat values clearly.

## 🖥 Example Output
Row 1  
1 2 3  
Row 2  
4 5  
Row 3  
6 7 8 9  

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run
1. Open the file in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
2. Build and run the solution (e.g., press Ctrl + F5).
