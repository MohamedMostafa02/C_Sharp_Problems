# Daily Sales For Different Products - C# Console Application

A simple C# console program that uses a **jagged array** to store and display daily sales data for multiple products, where each product can have a different number of daily sales entries.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Uses **jagged arrays** to handle variable-length sales data for each product.
- Displays sales data in a clean, readable format.
- Demonstrates looping with `for` and `foreach`.
- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

## üß† How It Works
1. A **jagged array** `productSales` is created to store sales data for multiple products.
2. Each element of the jagged array is an `int[]` containing sales values for that product.
3. The program loops through each product, printing its sales values.
4. A `Console.ReadKey()` is used at the end to pause the output until the user presses a key.

## üñ• Example Output
Sales Data:
Product 1
100 200 300
Product 2
300 400
Product 3
500 600 550 700

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Compile and Run
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio** or any C# IDE.
2. Copy the code into `Program.cs`.
3. Build and run the project.
4. View the printed sales data in the console.

## üì¶ Requirements
- .NET Framework or .NET Core SDK
- A C# compiler or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Rider, or Visual Studio Code with C# extension)
