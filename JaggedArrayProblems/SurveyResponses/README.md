# Survey Responses - C# Console Application

This C# console program demonstrates the use of a **jagged string array** to store and display survey responses from multiple respondents. Each respondent can have a different number of answers.

## ✅ Features
- Uses a jagged array of strings to hold variable-length survey responses.
- Prints responses clearly, grouped by each respondent.
- Simple and easy-to-understand looping with `for` and `foreach`.
- Suitable for beginner-level understanding of jagged arrays.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. A jagged array `surveyResponses` is declared for 3 respondents.
2. Each element is a string array containing answers from a single respondent.
3. The program loops through each respondent and prints their responses.
4. Console output pauses until a key is pressed.

## 🖥 Example Output
Survey Responses:
Respondent 1
Yes No 
Respondent 2
No Yes Yes 
Respondent 3
Yes 

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run
1. Open the project in a C# IDE like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
2. Paste the code into `Program.cs`.
3. Build and run the application.
4. View the printed survey responses in the console.

## 📦 Requirements
- .NET Framework or .NET Core SDK installed.
- C# compiler or IDE supporting .NET development.
