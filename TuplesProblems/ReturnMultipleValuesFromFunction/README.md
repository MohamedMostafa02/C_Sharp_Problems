# Return Multiple Values From Function - C# Console Application

This C# console program demonstrates how to return multiple values from a function using a **tuple** with named elements.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Uses C# tuples to return multiple related values from a single method.
- Shows how to define tuple elements with names for easier access.
- Simple example suitable for beginners learning modern C# features.

## üß† How It Works
1. The method `GetStudentDetails` returns a tuple containing the student's name, age, and grade.
2. The tuple elements are named (`name`, `age`, `grade`) for clear access.
3. In `Main`, the tuple returned by `GetStudentDetails` is stored in a variable.
4. The program prints the student's details by accessing the tuple fields by name.
5. The console waits for a key press before closing.

## üñ• Example Output
Name: Alice, Age: 20, Grade: 85.5

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Compile and Run
1. Open the code in a C# IDE such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
2. Paste the code into `Program.cs`.
3. Build and run the application.
4. View the output showing the returned tuple values.

## üì¶ Requirements
- .NET Framework or .NET Core SDK installed.
- C# compiler or IDE supporting C# 7.0 or later (for tuple support).
