# Store and Compare Employee Details - C#  
A simple C# console application that stores basic employee details (name and salary) using tuples, and compares their salaries.  
## ✅ Features  
- Stores employee details in a concise tuple format.  
- Compares salaries between two employees.  
- Displays whether the first employee earns a higher or lower salary than the second.  
- Uses the ternary operator for compact conditional logic.  
## 🧠 How It Works  
1. Two tuples are created, each representing an employee with `Name` and `Salary`.  
2. The salaries are compared using a ternary operator: if `employee1.Salary > employee2.Salary` → "higher" is displayed, otherwise → "lower" is displayed.  
3. The result is printed in a formatted string.  
4. `Console.ReadKey()` waits for user input before closing the program.  
## 🖥 Example Output  
Alice has lower salary than Bob
