# 🧠 Simple BackTracking in C#

This project demonstrates the basic concept of **Backtracking** using a **Stack** in C#.

---

## 📋 Project Description

We simulate a person visiting several locations (like a gas station, supermarket, work, café, and home). Each location is pushed onto a **Stack**, representing the path taken. Then we simulate **backtracking** by iterating through the stack to reverse the steps.

---

## 💡 Core Concept

- The **Stack** data structure works on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) basis.
- Each visited location is added using `stack.Push()`.
- Backtracking is simulated by iterating over the stack from top to bottom.
