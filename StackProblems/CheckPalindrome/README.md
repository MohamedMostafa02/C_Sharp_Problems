# CheckPalindrome

A simple C# console application that checks whether a given string is a **palindrome** using a **stack**.

## 💡 What is a Palindrome?

A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

### ✅ Examples of palindromes:
- `madam`
- `racecar`
- `level`

### ❌ Examples of non-palindromes:
- `hello`
- `world`
- `stack`

## 📂 Project Structure

```
CheckPalindrome/
├── Program.cs       // Main logic and test cases
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The program uses a **stack** to reverse the input string.
- It then compares the original string with the reversed version (character by character).
- If all characters match in reverse order, it's a palindrome.

## 🧪 Sample Output

```csharp
Is "madam" a palindrome? True
Is "hello" a palindrome? False
```
