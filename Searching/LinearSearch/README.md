# Linear Search

This project implements the Linear Search algorithm in C#.

## 📌 Description  
Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that checks every element in the array one by one until the target element is found or the end of the array is reached.  
It does **not** require the array to be sorted.

## ✅ Example  
Array: [4, 2, 7, 1, 9]  
Target: 7  
Result: Found at index 2

## 🧠 Time Complexity  
- Best Case: O(1) — if the element is the first one  
- Average Case: O(n)  
- Worst Case: O(n)

## 📁 Files  
- `Program.cs`: Contains the full implementation of Linear Search in C#.
