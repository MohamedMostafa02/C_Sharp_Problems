# 🗂️ Task Scheduling in C#

This project demonstrates a basic **task scheduling** system using a **Queue** in C#. It simulates how tasks are processed in a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) order.

---

## 📋 Project Description

A simple program that uses the `Queue` data structure to manage and execute a sequence of tasks. Tasks are added to the queue, and then processed one by one in the order they were added.

---

## 💡 Core Concept

- A **Queue** follows the **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** principle.
- Tasks are **enqueued** using `Enqueue()`.
- Tasks are **processed and removed** from the queue using `Dequeue()`.

---

## 🧪 Sample Output

```
Executing Tasks: 
Processing: Task1
Processing: Task2
Processing: Task3
Processing: Task4
```
