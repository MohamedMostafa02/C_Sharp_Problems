# Store and Retrieve Students' Grades – C# Console Application

📋 Description:
This is a simple C# console application that demonstrates how to use a Dictionary to store student names and their corresponding grades. It also shows how to retrieve a grade using a student's name.

💡 How It Works:
- A Dictionary<string, double> is used to map each student’s name (as a string) to their grade (as a double).
- The program then retrieves and displays the grade for a specific student (Bob in this example).

🧪 Example:
Dictionary:
{
  "Alice": 85.5,
  "Bob": 90.0,
  "Charlie": 78.5
}

Output:
Student: Bob, Grade: 90

🧑‍💻 Functions:
- Main() → Initializes the dictionary, retrieves a student's grade, and prints it to the console.

🧠 Concepts Used:
- Dictionary in C#
- Key-value data structure
- Console input/output

📦 Sample Output:
Student: Bob, Grade: 90
