# User Survey Results - C#  
A simple C# console application that stores and displays user survey responses using a `BitArray`, where each bit represents a user's yes/no answer.  
## ✅ Features  
- Stores boolean survey responses efficiently using `BitArray`.  
- Represents each user's answer as `true` (yes) or `false` (no).  
- Displays all stored responses with corresponding user numbers.  
## 🧠 How It Works  
1. A `BitArray` of length 5 is created to hold the responses of five users.  
2. Each index in the `BitArray` is assigned `true` (yes) or `false` (no).  
3. A `for` loop iterates through the `BitArray` and prints each user's response.  
4. The program waits for the user to press a key before closing.  
## 🖥 Example Output  
User 1 Response: True  
User 2 Response: False  
User 3 Response: True  
User 4 Response: True  
User 5 Response: False
