📘 README — FindLongestConsecutiveSequence Project

📂 Project Name:
FindLongestConsecutiveSequence

📝 Description:
This C# console application demonstrates two different approaches to find the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array of integers.

🧠 Key Concepts:
- HashSet for O(n) solution
- Sorting-based O(n log n) solution
- Handling duplicates and gaps
- Optimized iteration strategies

🚀 Features:
1. Efficient Method (O(n)) using HashSet:
   - Quickly checks if the current number starts a new sequence.
   - Continues checking forward elements to count the length.

2. Sorting Method (O(n log n)):
   - Sorts the array.
   - Skips duplicates and counts streaks of consecutive numbers.

📌 Sample Input:
int[] nums = { 100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2 };

✅ Sample Output:
4
4
(Both methods output the length of the sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4)

🛠 How to Run:
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
2. Run the project.
3. Check the output in the console.
