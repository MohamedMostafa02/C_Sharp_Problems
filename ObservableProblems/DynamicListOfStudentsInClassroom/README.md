# Dynamic List of Students in Classroom - C# Console App

This simple C# console application demonstrates how to use the `ObservableCollection<T>` class to track changes (additions and removals) in a dynamic list of students in a classroom. The program reacts in real-time to changes by printing messages to the console whenever a student is added or removed.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Uses `ObservableCollection<string>` to hold student names.
- Subscribes to the `CollectionChanged` event.
- Detects and logs added or removed students using lambda expression.
- Demonstrates basic reactive programming with collections in .NET.

## üß† How It Works
- An observable collection `students` is created.
- A lambda event handler is attached to the `CollectionChanged` event.
- When a student is added using `.Add()`, the event fires and logs: `"New Student Added: {StudentName}"`
- When a student is removed using `.Remove()`, the event fires and logs: `"Student Removed: {StudentName}"`

## üñ• Example Output
New Student Added: Alice  
New Student Added: Bob  
Student Removed: Alice

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Compile and Run
1. Open the project in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
2. Make sure `System.Collections.ObjectModel` and `System.Collections.Specialized` namespaces are included.
3. Press **F5** to run or use `dotnet run` in terminal if using .NET Core.

## üì¶ Requirements
- .NET Framework or .NET Core
- C# Compiler
- Console Application Environment
