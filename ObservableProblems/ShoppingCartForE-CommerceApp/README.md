# Shopping Cart Observer - C# Console App

This is a simple C# console application that simulates a shopping cart using ObservableCollection<string> to automatically detect and respond to changes (Add, Remove, Replace) in the cart items.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Automatically detects when an item is added to the cart.
- Automatically detects when an item is removed from the cart.
- Detects when an item is replaced (e.g., Mouse ‚ûù Keyboard).
- Demonstrates how to use the CollectionChanged event of ObservableCollection.

## üß† How It Works
- The shopping cart is represented by an ObservableCollection<string>.
- The CollectionChanged event is subscribed to, allowing the app to print messages whenever:
  - An item is added ‚Üí NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add
  - An item is removed ‚Üí NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Remove
  - An item is replaced ‚Üí NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Replace
- The event handler reads from e.NewItems and e.OldItems depending on the action.

## üñ• Example Output
Item Added to cart: Laptop  
Item Added to cart: Mouse  
Item Replaced: Mouse with keyboard  
Item Removed from cart: Laptop
