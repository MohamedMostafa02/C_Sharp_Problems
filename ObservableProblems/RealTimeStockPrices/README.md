# üìà Real-Time Stock Price Tracker ‚Äì C# Console App

This is a simple C# console application that simulates a **real-time stock price tracker** using `ObservableCollection` and event handling. It prints a message whenever a stock price is **added** or **removed** from the collection.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Uses `ObservableCollection<string>` to store stock prices.
- Responds to real-time changes in the collection using the `CollectionChanged` event.
- Displays messages in the console whenever a stock is added or removed.

## üß† How It Works
- The app creates an `ObservableCollection<string>` called `stockPrices`.
- It subscribes to the `CollectionChanged` event to monitor when:
  - New stock prices are added.
  - Existing stock prices are removed.
- Event handler uses `NotifyCollectionChangedAction` to determine the type of change and prints the result.

## üñ• Example Output
New Stock Price Added: AAPL: 150.00  
New Stock Price Added: MSFT: 240.50  
Stock Price Removed: AAPL: 150.00
